# The following defines the version and build number for your application.
# A version number is three numbers separated by dots, like 1.2.43
# followed by an optional build number separated by a +.
# Both the version and the builder number may be overridden in flutter
# build by specifying --build-name and --build-number, respectively.
# In Android, build-name is used as versionName while build-number used as versionCode.
# Read more about Android versioning at https://developer.android.com/studio/publish/versioning
# In iOS, build-name is used as CFBundleShortVersionString while build-number is used as CFBundleVersion.
# Read more about iOS versioning at
# https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/General/Reference/InfoPlistKeyReference/Articles/CoreFoundationKeys.html
# In Windows, build-name is used as the major, minor, and patch parts
# of the product and file versions while build-number is used as the build suffix.

  ##shared_preferences应用场景,主要用于持久化数据，如持久化用户信息、列表数据等。
  #因为用户信息基本是不改变的，而在一个应用程序中常常会有多个页面需要展示用户信息，我们不可能每次都去获取接口，那么本地持久化就会变得很方便。
  #为了给用户更好的体验，在获取列表数据时我们常常会先展示旧数据，带给用户更好的体验，不至于一打开页面就是空白的，当我们采用持久化列表数据后，可以直接先展示本地数据，当网络数据请求回来后在进行数据更新。
